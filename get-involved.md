# Get Involved

Your help can make big difference

Getting involved with the **Apache Royale** Community is easy!

We are an open-source community governed by the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/). Everything we do is out in the open with the entire community involved. All decisions are made on our [mailing lists](/mailing-lists/), and all [source code](/source-code/) is committed to [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/royale-asjs/wiki/Apache-Royale-Source-Code-Repositories).

## Find out what is going on

If you are interested in what is going on with the project, subscribe to our [mailing lists](/mailing-lists/). Our [dev@royale.apache.org](mailto:dev@royale.apache.org) mailing list is where additions and changes to the SDK are discussed. The list is open to everybody, and everybody is encouraged to give their opinions on anything discussed on the list. This is a great place to introduce yourself and let us know how you can help.

If you are interested in helping end-users of the SDK, we also host the [users@royale.apache.org](mailto:users@royale.apache.org) mailing list. This list is designed for end-users to talk about how to use the SDK and how to build applications that utilize the SDK.

## Contributing Documentation

If you are ready to help us document code, provide tips and tricks, or anything else that is not straight-up code, we have an [Apache Royale Wiki](https://github.com/apache/royale-asjs/wiki) on GitHub that allows for community contribution. Simply let us know on the [dev@royale.apache.org](mailto:dev@royale.apache.org) mailing list that you wish to get write access to the Wiki.

You can contribute in this website with [blog entries and articles](/blog/). Share with us your Royale-related videos, screencasts, applications to showcase, and other materials that you have created. We would love to help publicize them!

## Reporting Bugs

All bug reports that we receive are housed on the [GitHub Issues system](https://github.com/apache/royale-asjs/issues). To let us know about a bug, [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/royale-asjs/issues/new/choose). GitHub automatically emails the dev mailing list and hopefully somebody will take a look at it.

It is really important that you give us as much information on the bug as possible. Even better, if you have a way to reproduce the bug, submit a code sample that can help us reproduce it. Feel free to contribute to the comments as the bug gets worked on.

## Squashing Bugs

Bugs happen, and you might know how to fix one! Because we don't allow everybody write access to the official code repository (everybody has access to read, though!), there is an additional process that has to occur to submit a fix. To help us squash bugs, do the following:

1. Find a bug you want to work on, or submit one into GitHub. Make a comment on the ticket that you plan on working on it so others don't duplicate your work.
1. Check out the source code from the Git repository. More information is available on the [Source Code](/source-code/) page.
1. Set up your build environment. Check out the _README_ file included in the source code on how to do this. You will want to make
sure that you can perform a compile before you go much further.
1. Fix the bug. If you need help, ask the [dev@royale.apache.org](mailto:dev@royale.apache.org) mailing list. We're sure to offer pointers to help you out.
1. [Create a new pull request on Github](https://github.com/apache/royale-asjs/compare)
1. A committer will review the patch and make sure it dosen't break anything else.
1. Sit back and bask in the glory that you helped make Royale better!

## Contributing Code

Due to legal reasons, only people who have been elected as committers have access to update or contribute code directly to the project. We at Apache take the legal status of code seriously, and nothing would be worse than somebody contributing code that they don't own and a third party then having a legal claim to our framework.

That being said, you can submit code by [providing a pull request to the project on Github](https://github.com/apache/royale-asjs/pulls). To do this, [create a new pull request](https://github.com/apache/royale-asjs/compare).

If you submit a few patches that meet the Apache standards, you will probably be contacted by the [PMC](/team/) to provide you with direct access to the Git repository and for you to be recognized for your work as a committer.

## Nightly Builds

We provide two kind of nightly build packages. The first one only output JavaScript and the other one outputs JavaScript and SWF.

> These nightly builds are generated from our development branch, which means the distributions may not be fully functional and/or could contain bugs. **We strongly recommend not to use this nightly builds in production environments.**
