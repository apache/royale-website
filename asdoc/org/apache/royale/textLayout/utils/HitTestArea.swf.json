    "description": "The HitTestArea class is a lightweight implementation of the Warnock algorithm for rectangles. It is used for hit-testing in FlowElements, which may contain multiple child elements. The algorithm attempts to set the logical midpoint to be outside of a bounding rectangle to avoid having to split too many rectangles. Note that the code is optimized for non-overlapping rectangles; the determination of the logical midpoint does not work well for overlapping rectangles because the algorithm breaks once it found a rectangle that contains the geometric midpoint.  The pseudocode for this algorithm is:  if !(point in this rectangle) return false; if !(hasKids) return true; determine the quadrant where the point is in (top left &quot;tl&quot;, top right &quot;tr&quot;, bottom left &quot;bl&quot;, or bottom right &quot;br&quot;); if this[quadrant] == null, return false; // no rectangle covers this area else return this[quadrant].hitTest(x,y);  To avoid having to create a 4-element array for the four quadrants, the code constructs the property name and accesses the property with dynamic lookup.",
