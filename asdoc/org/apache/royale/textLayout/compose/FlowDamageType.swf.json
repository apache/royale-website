    "description": "The FlowDamageType class is an enumeration class that defines types of damage for damage methods and events. When the text content is updated, these changes are reflected in the TextLines after an update. TextLines are marked with a flag that specifies whether or not they are valid, or up to date with all text changes. When the text is first updated, all lines are marked valid or static. After the text has been changed, and before the next update, lines will be marked with a FlowDamageType that specifies what about the line is invalid. Once the update is done, lines will again be marked as valid or static.",
