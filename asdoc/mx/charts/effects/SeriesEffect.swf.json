For example, an effect with a <code>duration</code> of <code>1000</code> and an <code>elementOffset</code> of <code>100</code> takes 900 milliseconds per element to complete an effect if you have two elements in the series. This is because the start of each effect is offset by 100 and each effect finishes in 1000 milliseconds.</p>  <p>If there are four elements in the series, each element takes 700 milliseconds to complete (the last effect starts 300 milliseconds after the first and must be completed within 1000 milliseconds). With 10 elements, each element has only 100 milliseconds</p> to complete the effect.  <p>The <code>minimumElementDuration</code> value sets a minimal duration for each element. No element of the series takes less than this amount of time (in milliseconds) to execute the effect, regardless of the number of elements in the series and the value of the <code>duration</code> property. As a result, it is possible for an effect to take longer than a specified <code>duration</code> if at least two of the following three properties are specified: <code>duration</code>, <code>offset</code>, and <code>minimumElementDuration</code>.</p>  <p>The default is <code>0</code>.</p>",
