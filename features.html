  <img src="/img/apache-royale-tm-logo-side.svg" style="float:right;width:250px">
  <p>Apache Royale is a powerful, <a href="/source-code">open source</a> application technology that lets you easily build desktop, browser, and mobile applications for multiple devices and operating systems â€” all using the same programming model, tools, and codebase.</p>
  <p>You can use the Apache Royale SDK to create a wide range of highly interactive, expressive applications. For example, a data visualization application built in Royale can pull data from multiple back-end sources and display it in charts, tables, or other methods of your choice. Business users can drill down into the data for deeper insight and even change the data and have it automatically updated on the back end.</p>

  <h2>Enterprise-class programming model</h2>
  <p>Use constructs like strong typing, inheritance, and interfaces to program more efficiently with <a href="https://apache.github.io/royale-docs/features/as3">ActionScript 3.0</a> and <a href="https://apache.github.io/royale-docs/features/mxml">MXML</a>. Extensive mobile and traditional components help speed development. Royale applications can access device capabilities such as GPS, accelerometer, camera, and local database. Enjoy a cross-platform and native experience. Create applications that run consistently across Android and iOS mobile devices, as well as inside web browsers, and on traditional desktop computers. Royale gives you cross-platform development efficiency, and your application users enjoy an uncompromised native experience on each platform.</p>

  <h2>Strands &amp; Beads</h2>
  <p>Royale is designed from scratch with a composition philosophy that gives you lightweight UI components with all the functionality you need for your applications, but without any features you will not use and that only add extra weight.</p>

  <p><a href="https://apache.github.io/royale-docs/component-sets/jewel">Jewel</a> is an all new UI component set, created with design and responsiveness in mind.

  <h2>Flex Emulation Components</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://apache.github.io/royale-docs/component-sets/mxroyale">MXRoyale</a> and <a href="https://apache.github.io/royale-docs/component-sets/sparkroyale">SparkRoyale</a> UI component sets are designed to assist <a href="https://flex.apache.org/">Apache Flex</a> users migrating to Apache Royale. If you are familiar with Flex's MX and Spark component libraries, you'll feel right at home using these components in Royale. The components are designed to work the same as their Flex counterparts, but composed using Royale's strand and bead system.</p>
