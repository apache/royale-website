          "description": "A converter that converts clipboard data into a TextFlow should use the MERGE_TO_NEXT_ON_PASTE property to control how the elements are treated when they are merged into an existing TextFlow on paste. This is useful if you want special handling for the case where only part of the element is copied. For instance, wheh a list is copied, if only part of the list is copied, and you paste it into another list, it merges into the list as additional items. If the entire list is copied, it appears as a nested list. When TLF creates a TextFlow for use on the clipboard, it decorates any partial elements with user properties that control whether the end of the element should be merged with the one after it. This user property is never pasted into the final TextFlow, but it may go on the elements in the TextScrap.textFlow. When copying text, the converter has the option to look for these properties to propagate them into the format that is posted on the clipboard. For instance, the plain text exporter checks the &quot;mergeToNextOnPaste&quot; property on paragraphs and supresses the paragraph terminator if it is found set to true. Likewise on import if the incoming String has no terminator, and useClipboardAnnotations is true, then it calls <code>setStyle(MERGE_TO_NEXT_ON_PASTE, &quot;true&quot;)</code> on the corresponding paragraph so that when it is pasted it will blend into the paragraph where its pasted. This property should only be set on elements in a TextScrap, and only on the last element in the scrap.",
